Introduction
------------

This repository contains all the configuration files that I (Sean Leather) use
with Git across various platforms.

*Note:* `.gitconfig` should not include an email address (user.email) or Github
tokens.

Usage
-----

Run the [`install.sh`](./install.sh) script.

To do
-----

At some point, I should investigate if all my platforms support the somewhat new
[include] directive.
