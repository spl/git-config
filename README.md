Introduction
------------

This repository contains all the configuration files that I (Sean Leather) use
with Git across various platforms.

Usage
-----

Create the appropriate links from $HOME to each of the files in this repository.

 * `.gitconfig` - the primary configuration file

*Note:* This file should not include an email address (user.email) or Github
tokens.

To do
-----

At some point, I should investigate if all my platforms support the somewhat new
[include] directive.
